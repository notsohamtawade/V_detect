This project is programmed with the purpose of measuring the efficiency of CNG pumps by using a simple formula of Carnot Engine in Thermodynamics.


1) The v_detect.py is a model built from the YOLOV3 API for object detection. We used the SSD MOBILENET V2 FPN LITE 640X640 for vehicle detection.
    It displays the a real-time cip of the vehicles along with their type and count.

2) The vehicle_detectmk2 is a version of our model specifically designed to fill data into a CSV file for further analytics purposes.
